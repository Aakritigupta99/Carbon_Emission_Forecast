# Week 2 – Data Understanding, EDA & Prediction

## Summary
Performed EDA on annual CO₂ emissions and built a simple Linear Regression model to forecast future CO₂ emissions.

## Model Metrics
- Model: Linear Regression
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): *paste your MSE here*
- R² score: *paste your R² here*

## Improvisations (what I did this week)
I performed exploratory data analysis, cleaned the dataset, visualized global and country-level emission trends, trained a Linear Regression model, and predicted CO₂ emission values for 2025–2030.
