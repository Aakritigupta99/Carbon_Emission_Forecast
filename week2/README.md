# 📘 Week 2 – Data Understanding, EDA & Prediction

## 🎯 Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the annual carbon emission dataset and build a simple Linear Regression model to forecast future CO₂ emissions.

---

## 🧩 Tasks Completed
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (`carbon_emission_data.csv`)
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized global CO₂ emission trends and top emitting countries
- Built a Linear Regression model for CO₂ emission prediction
- Predicted emission levels for the years 2025–2030
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error and R² Score

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| **Model Used** | Linear Regression |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** | 1.2805730867708099e+19 |
| **R² Score** | 0.6623401883275715 |

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- CO₂ emissions have shown an overall increasing trend globally.  
- A small group of countries contributes to the majority of emissions.  
- The Linear Regression model achieved an R² score of around 0.66, indicating a moderate predictive capability.  
- Future predictions (2025–2030) show a continuing rise in emissions.
